Disable Database Connection:
    Temporarily disable the connectDB() function for testing purposes. This will prevent the application from connecting to the database.

Update Client Base URL:
    Replace the CLIENT_BASE_URL variable with the actual URL of your frontend application hosted online.

Use Valid Nodemailer Credentials:
    Replace the placeholder credentials in your Nodemailer configuration with your valid email credentials.

Run Server:
    Start the development server using "npm start".
    npm start

Run Tests:
    Execute the test suite using "npm test" to verify the functionality of your application.
    npm test
    
Additional Notes:
    Remember to re-enable the connectDB() function and update the CLIENT_BASE_URL with the correct production values before deploying your application.
    Consult your email provider's documentation for specific configuration steps if using Nodemailer.
